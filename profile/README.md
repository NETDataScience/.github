# NETDataScience

This organization will contain a collection of open-source cross-platform data science libraries for .NET written in .NET.

The current plans are to have libraries for:

* Generic number processing - Similar to NumPy
* Neural networks
* Reinforcement learning
* a reinforcement learning training gym
* 2D & 3D Physics (possibly)

**Warning**: The organization may be renamed in the future if someone can think of a better name. See [Organization Name Ideas](https://github.com/NETDataScience/.github/issues/1).

*Note*: Development will start in late 2021 and may not initially be public.
